    ## Putting the intercept at the barycenter of time amounts to use
    ## a "weighted orthogonal" design matrix in the regression (that
    ## is, X'WX = I for some diagonal weight matrix W). In theory,
    ## there would be one orthogonal design matrix per contract. In
    ## practice, we orthogonalize with a "collective" barycenter. We
    ## use average weights per period across contracts since these
    ## will be closest to the their individual analogues.
    ##
    ## We orthogonalize the original design matrix using QR
    ## decomposition. We also keep matrix R as a transition matrix
    ## between the original base and the orthogonal base.

    ## fit some sort of empty model to ease use in predict.hache().
