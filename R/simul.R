### actuar: Actuarial Functions and Heavy Tailed Distributions
###
### Simulation of hierarchical portfolios of data. Claim number and
### claim amounts in any given node are simulated independently. Both
### frequency and severity models can be mixtures of distributions.
###
### In the code here, numbering of levels starts at 1 at the data
### level, whereas in common discussion of hierarchical models the
### data level is numbered 0.
